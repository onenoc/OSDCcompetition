This project reads in dates from a csv into a list of strings.  The user specifies which column the dates are in.
Then, it provides a function to parse the list of strings and convert them to a list of datetime objects.  Currently, it only works for two string formats.

Eventually, this should be extended to parse more than two string formats, and a wide range of data types besides datetimes (most will be floats).
